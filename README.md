A simple Java Program in which -:
1) there is s student class having constructor, getters, setters, toString
2) serial class creates the student object and sends it to object.txt file.
3) deserial class reads the object.txt byte data and convert it into student object
4) fileInputStream,fileOutputStream,ObjectStream packages have nothing to do with this.They are made just to explain themselves.If you dont understand what fileOutputStream does then read the
   Test.java file in its package
